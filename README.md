# Description

**I followed [1] for most of the coding, but tried to structure the whole project in a more meaningful way.**

The whole project can be divided into 6 parts.
1. Reading, preprocessing and loading the data
2. Model design and implementation; loss formulation and implementation
3. Training model with validation and hyper parameter tuning (hopefully :D)
4. Processing outputs of the model using Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)
5. Evaluating the model using mAP (11pt & all pt) on testing data
6. Detecting objects in images, videos and live feeds.

# 1. Reading, preprocessing and loading the data
## Data
- PascalVOC: 2007, 2012
